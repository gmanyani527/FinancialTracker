# Project Title

## Description of the Project

Financial Tracker is a Java console application that helps users manage their personal finances. Users can add deposits, make deposits
, view transactions history through a ledger, and then generate simple reports from user preference. A bonus feature that has been
added is the feature to be able to custom search any transaction in the reports menu liked a filtered search. I would say the best use case for this application
would be for those that are interested in tracking their income and their financial goals.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see a main menu that has clear options, so that I can choose what action I want to do
- As a user, I want to have the option to add a deposit in the menu, so that I can record money that has been added to my account
- As a user, I want to record a payment transaction so that my outgoing expenses are tracked and saved
- As a user, I want to view all my transactions, or filter by deposits or payments, so that I can track my financial history more easily.
- As a user, I want to generate various filtered reports (by date or vendor) so I can analyze my transactions efficiently.
- As a user, I want to filter my transactions between two specific dates so that I can view only relevant financial data for a given time period.
- As a user, I want to search my transactions by vendor so that I can quickly find all payments or deposits made to a specific vendor.
- As a user, I want to search for transactions using multiple filters (date range, description, vendor, amount) so that I can narrow down my results based on specific criteria.
